# Databricks-Uni-Project
Project created for class at WSE.

Since the .ipynb version is breaking the graphs (I made most of them using menu on Databricks portal and as a result, in .ipynb you can se just raw data), here you can access the report:

https://databricks-prod-cloudfront.cloud.databricks.com/public/4027ec902e239c93eaaa8714f173bcfc/6096676442202780/1751517553296894/1915520108232404/latest.html

You can also use the .html report in repo to see graphs. It's friendlier to look at than .ipynb.
